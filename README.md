## Setup Instructions

Before running the project, you need to set up the Gmail and Discord APIs and generate tokens for them. 

1. **Discord Token**: Place the Discord token in the `param.json` file.
2. **Gmail Token**: Place the Gmail token in the `/token/token.pickle` file. If you run the program manually, a Google prompt will ask for this token.
3. **Admin ID** : Provide your admin ID in the `param.json` file

Then place this file in the `/token` folder.

## Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py
